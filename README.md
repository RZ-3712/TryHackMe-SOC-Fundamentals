# TryHackMe: SOC Fundamentals
ðŸ”— [SOC Fundamentals Room Link](https://tryhackme.com/room/socfundamentals)

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

This TryHackMe room aims to build foundational knowledge and skills of an SOC (Security Operations Center), demonstrate how detection and response are the main focus of an SOC team, and explain the three pillars, which are people, process and technology. The project also includes a practical exercise where you get to experience what it's like to solve a real-world SOC alert as a level 1 Analyst of your organizationâ€™s SOC team.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Detection and response in SOC.
- The three pillars (people, process and technology) and how they play their roles in the day-to-day SOC use cases.
- Ability to solve real-world SOC alerts as a level 1 Analyst.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

-  SIEM solution.

## Tasks
- Developed a strong understanding of the detection of vulnerabilties, unauthorized activity, policy violations and intrusions. Also learned about the certain steps that are taken to respond to an incident and how the SOC team helps the incident response team carry out these steps.
- People: Developed a strong understanding of the roles of an SOC team, which are SOC Analysts levels 1-3, a security engineer, detection engineer, SOC manager and the CISO. Also learned about their responsibilities.
- Pillars: Developed a strong understanding of the formalized procedures and workflows that guide SOC operations.
- Technology: Developed a strong understanding of the tools and platforms that enable threat detection, investigation, and response. Key technologies include SIEM, EDR and firewalls.
- Practical exercise: You are the Level 1 Analyst of your organizationâ€™s SOC team. You receive an alert that a port scanning activity has been observed on one of the hosts in the network. You have access to the SIEM solution, where you can see all the associated logs for this alert. The task is to view the logs individually and determine what triggered the alert, time of the activity, destination host IP and more.
